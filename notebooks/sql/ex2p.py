Example 2 - Simulation - Python

Simulation Bank renege example taken from:
https://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/bank_renege.html
Scenario:
  A counter with a random service time and customers who renege. Based on the
  program bank08.py from TheBank tutorial of SimPy 2. (KGM)

Requires random, numpy, sys and simpy packages.

Required input:
- table ex2tbl defined in ex2dataTblDef.txt
- ex2tbl data from file ex2data.txt

Input parameters:
INTERVAL_CUSTOMERS : Time interval (minutes) between customer entries
MIN_PATIENCE       : Minimum time (minutes) customers will wait
MAX_PATIENCE       : Maximum time (minutes) customers will wait
TIME_IN_BANK       : Time (minutes) a customer spends being served
MAX_MINUTES        : Process observation time (minutes)

Output:
Number of customers that visited in MAX_MINUTES
Number of customers that reneged in MAX_MINUTES
Average waiting time per customer
